Hi there,

someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{email}}.
Follow the link below:
{{protocol}}://{{domain}}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

incase you forgot your django boards username: {{user.username}}

If clicking the link above doesnt work, please copy and paset the url in a new 
browser window instead

If you've received this mail in error, its likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didnt
initiate the request, you dont need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email

Thanks,

Team
